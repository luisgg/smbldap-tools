What those tools are for?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

A collection of scripts, «over» user{add,del,mod} and group{add,del,mod}
system tools to manipulate users and groups stored in LDAP directory,
for DEN system like Samba-LDAP and pam/nss_ldap systems.

Additionnaly, some scripts are designed to ease your migration from
a Windows NT 4.0 PDC Server to a Samba-LDAP PDC Server (Killer?;-):
smbldap-populate and doc/migration_scripts/smbldap-migrate.

They are currently used with Samba 3.2 and later.

In the future, some other function may come (like backup and restore,
Novell migration tools, samba system activity report, dealing with
mail functions, compliance to RFC2307...): consult TODO.


What do SMBLDAP-TOOLS provide?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Those tools provide the following functions :
  * Populate LDAP database with a basic LDIF
  * Add a user or group
  * Delete a user or group
  * Modify all users or groups data (all attributes types stored in
    posixAccount, posixGroup and sambaSamAccount object class)
Taking care of :
  * Staying compatible with all standard system tools options
    (user/group{add,del,mod})
  * Be extensible for future developments
    (manipulation of shadow account options, for example)
  * Error management, in the way system tools do
Constraints :
  * Usage of Perl (portability)
  * All options must be placed in an external configuration file
  * English localization


What do SMBLDAP-TOOLS deliver?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Contents :
  * Scripts (see FILES)
  * User documentation in pod format, included in the sources
    (or just use the -? option)

These tools aim at delivering the same functionality as the corresponding
system tools
